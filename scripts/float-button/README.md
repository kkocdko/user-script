Insert a floating button in the web page (for developers only).

### Features

* Follow [Material Design] (https://material.io), beautiful and practical.

* Use [Shadow Dom] (https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM), **ensure** that the float button style does not conflict with the global style.

* When the code is run multiple times (multiple UserJS uses this code), only one button container will be created (avoid conflicts).

* Click the dot in the upper left corner to toggle the button to hide/show to avoid obscuring the page content.
